# Pacman-Factory
This is a project that allowed for creation of a "pacman factory". It reminds me of a chaotic screensaver. When the button "make one is pressed, a new pacman is added to the game div. Each are positioned at random with a random velocity.
This initial product makes use of only one image within the Pacman image array. Goals for progression will to be add the alternate images to change image direction with direction changes, as well as rotate between open and closed mouth.
