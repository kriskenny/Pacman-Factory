# Pacmen
Factory for making Pacmen
This program has two buttons. One button creates a pacman in a random position that will run at a random velocity. The second button starts the "game", which allows for the Pacman to move around the screen, bouncing off of the walls.
This first iteration only uses one picture. Goals for progression will be to incorporate the other pictures included in the code to allow for change of direction and rotation through open and closed mouth to make the PacMan image more dynamic.
